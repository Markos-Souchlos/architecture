    <h2>Design Concept</h2>
    <p>The design of the Contemporary Loft in Malia is inspired by the industrial lofts of urban cities, combined with the warm textures and natural tones of the Mediterranean. Exposed concrete walls, steel accents, and large glass panels give the space a modern edge, while wooden elements and soft lighting create a welcoming environment.</p>
    <p>The open-plan layout emphasizes flexibility and flow, with large windows and skylights flooding the interior with natural light. A private terrace extends the living space, connecting residents to the outdoors and offering views of the surrounding town and coastline.</p>
